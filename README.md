README

a) MachineLearning -- main class, from it you could enter all of the other frames

d) JMLRadioButtonsCheckBox -- there you could check your preliminaries for the courses, it would be good to have basic knowledge regarding at least 4 of them

b) JMLButtons -- getting more information, graphics, and adding text area about neural networks -- the most basic concept used in almost all ML architectures

c) JMLIndependentCalc -- as the course is free, there you are able to make a donation and to compute the cost of it, the donations are made by d1(the first text field)-- for how many months is made the donation; the other three fields are for values that you would like to be donating each month, the total cost is computed as months*(oone donations plus second donation plus third donation)

e) date time
